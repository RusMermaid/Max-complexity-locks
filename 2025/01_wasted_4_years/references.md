## Papers

- `07:39` - Agrawal, M., Kayal, N., & Saxena, N. (2004). PRIMES is in P. Annals of mathematics, 781-793.

> This paper proves that the question "Is `x` a prime number?" where `x` is an `n`-digit number,
can be solved in "polynomial time." In other words, there is an algorithm that solves the problem in `f(n)` amount of time, where `f(n)` is a polynomial function of `n` (the length of the number).
> 
> Using the terms in our video, you could say they've found a way to 'solve this problem efficiently without an eraser.'
> 
> (Just for clarification, this doesn't solve the P vs PSPACE problem at all. "Is x a prime number?" just happened to be an easy enough problem that can be solved efficiently.)

## Websites

- `04:14` - [Gridbach](https://app.gridbach.com/record)

> A website dedicated to bruteforcing(?) the Goldbach conjecture.
> You can use your computer to check if large even numbers are the sum of two prime numbers.
> 
> Who knows, maybe you find a counterexample to the Goldbach conjecture and prove it wrong?
> (This is HIGHLY unlikely)
