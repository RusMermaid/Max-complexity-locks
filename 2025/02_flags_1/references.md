[Flags of the World(FOTW)](https://www.fotw.info/flags/country.html)

> A website devoted to vexillology. Contains lots of valuable information along with decades-old quips of many enthusiasts.
> Not really an 'academic source' per se, but one of the most vast and reliable sources about flags.

[Konstruktionsmuster internationaler Flaggen](https://austria-forum.org/attach/AEIOU/Vexillologie/construction%20sheets%20A-Z.pdf)

> Construction sheet of 229 countries provided by [Austria-Forum](https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Vexillologie). Unfortunately I don’t know who compiled this database.
> Contains some construction sheets with incomplete sources and a few typos. Mostly reliable.

[Construction sheets by Wikipedia user MapGrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MapGrid/flag_construction_sheets)

> Goated user who contributes to a lot of flag construction sheets on Wikipedia.

The above three sources, along with the Wikipedia pages for "Flag of (country name)", were referenced for basically every flag construction.
